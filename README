Distributed Mesh Sensor Network using Raspberry Pi's
----------------------------------------------------

Motivation
----------
The goal for this project evolved over time, my initial idea was to implement
 a mesh network of sensors for monitoring various aspects a body of water and
 building a front end that could display this information.
when I began doing my initial research into the area for my literature review,
I discovered that there was a distinct lack of tooling for deploying Pi's and
 other SBC's as IoT devices.
I began to create a tool that could facilitate this, as it would save
 time deploying devices for my original idea anyway.
It quickly became clear that this tool was of far greater value as a number
 of colleagues asked for the tool, and flagged issues with it.

From all of this the project pivoted to the title I have now.

Breakdown
---------
This repository contains the all of the code for the project, and in the docs
 folder contains the dissertation that accompanies this.

Structure
---------
The `prepare-sd.sh` is the primary file and handles the user interaction.
The Raspbian Lite image is obtained and cached locally by this upon runtime,
 meaning no additional work is required.
By default Pi's are named according to whether they are a **Bridge** or
 a **Node**.
A Bridge is the bridge to the main network and allows the data collected from
 the nodes to be accessed, ideally this device would have two network
 adapters be a bridge.
A Node is a device that reports back on the network.

Usage
-----
To use this in your project, you need only edit the `lib/setup.sh` to add your
 own changes and optionally the `server` folder to add your own frontend.
From there simply run the script and answer questiosn related to your setup.
```
	$ prepare-sd.sh
```
